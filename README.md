Just walked outta The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep and whoa, my brain is like... soup. The kind with too many ingredients but somehow it all works? Theater was chaos, you know? Noise levels through the roof, started with a seat that reclines but at at some point it felt like wrestling with an inanimate chiropractic nightmare. Popcorn crumbs invading every crevasse like a million tiny invaders.

The opening scene, man, with Geralt and Yennefer on the cliff, crazy waves crashing louder than a thousand marbles in a blender. Do waves care about plot development? Guess not. But those CGI sirens?? Unbelievable. Like if Van Gogh painted on a digital canvas... but with extra teeth. Ridiculous and kind of beautiful.

> And did you notice how the color grading was like a dream where everything’s tinted blue? Almost dunked my face in popcorn, wondering why my usual buttery yellow wasn’t looking right. What even is normal after witnessing an undersea dance-off between a crocodile and what I think was a jellyfish with command of ancient magic?

That underwater sequence though, when Ciri was navigating through the Atlantis kind of place. It felt like diving inside Picasso’s brain after he’s had too much espresso or something. My back’s never gonna forgive those seats for this journey. Could hardly hold the camera in my mind’s eye — wild patterns that would never develop improperly on actual 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 stock.

And oh, the costumes! Temeria would be jealous. Outfits that scream “I pulled this out of another realm” while also whispering sweet witcher nothings. Probably why someone whispered to me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ... 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just for that fabric flow. 

Random pause mid-battle, imagining snapping shots of Geralt mid-swing, sword arc catching light just right. Balancing focus on chaos is like threading a needle wearing oven mitts. Can still feel Sword fight tension in my fingertips honestly.

Someone actually dropped a whole soda cup two rows down, sounded like an unplanned symbol crash in a symphony of swords clashing.

And if you’re wondering about Dandelion’s new ballad — catchy. Like if a guitar solo married a Shakespeare sonnet in a forest and decided to raise their offspring on reverberations and verse.
